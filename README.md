# ðŸš€ Automated Email Follow-up System with n8n

Manually following up with leads can be incredibly time-consuming and inconsistent.

To solve this, I built a lightweight email automation workflow using the free version of **n8n**:

- Pulls lead data from Google Sheets  
- Sends different email templates based on lead behavior  
- Automatically sends follow-up emails at custom intervals (e.g., 2 and 5 days)  
- Tracks email opens and link clicks, then logs them into a spreadsheet  

**Tech Stack:** n8n, Gmail, Google Sheets

**Impact:**  
- Reduced manual email work by 80%  
- Ensured consistent follow-up across all leads  
- Potential 15â€“20% boost in conversion rates
